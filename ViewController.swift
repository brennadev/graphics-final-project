//  Due to how the iOS API is set up, even for simple stuff, it has to be set up with MVC
//  This file just handles the UI input and the very start of the Metal setup

// A small amount of code (where noted) came from a raywenderlich.com tutorial (I downloaded the code a while back) - as some stuff from the website has changed, I'm not sure if this is even from a current version of an article, but this is so you at least know what website I got the code from and provided the licensing info
